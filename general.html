			Welcome to the Mixedwood Plains, Canada’s smallest yet most populated ecozone. With over 16 million people in 2006, and 52% of Canada’s population in 1991, this ecozone contains approximately half of Canada’s population while only having 1.2% of Canada’s area. Alongside a high population, the ecozone is the most industrially and commercially productive region, with a GDP totalling at $325 billion in 1991, which was 55% of Canada’s total GDP that year.

			<p>
The Mixedwood Plains is also Canada’s furthest south ecozone, extending down to the Great Lakes. The total land area that the ecozone covers is 118, 870 km2, and the land is spread across the shores of the St. Lawrence River, as well as the nearby Great Lakes. The majority of people in the region live in urban cities, with the high amount of money and development in the region.
			</p>
			<p>
Alongside the high population, there are many tourists that visit the cities and landmarks of the region. Some famous landmarks include the CN Tower in Toronto, the Niagara Falls, Bruce Peninsula, and some historic cities in Montreal and Quebec.
			</p>
			<p>
Many people choose to settle and immigrate to the Mixedwood Plains because of its thriving urban centers, abundance of resources, as well as a temperate climate. The thriving industrial and commercial sectors of the ecozone leads to many jobs and small businesses, and the abundance of resources such as fresh water and good farmland gives way to a high quality of life. The temperate climate is warm by Canadian standards, and not unbearably cold or hot at any time of the year.
