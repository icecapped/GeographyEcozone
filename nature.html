			The Mixedwood Plains are home to a diverse array of plants and animals, different trees, as well as invasive waterlife. The urbanization of the area has also harmed the environment, and few of the original forests of the region exist today, with the rest cut for logging or land.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Waterlife</h2>
            <p class="break">
			The ecozone initially contained lots of fish, which were lost to overfishing over time. However, most of the original species still exist, such as the Lake Trout, Whitefish, Sturgeon, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass. Another impact of humans in terms of waterlife is the large number of invasive species. Because the St. Lawrence River is utilized for heavy naval trading, the cargo ships also bring along many invasive species, such as the Sea Lamprey, Common Carp, and White Perch. One of the most notorious invasive species is the Zebra mussel, which clogs water infrastructure and reduces the amount of plankton in the waters, making it harder on the native shellfish and ecosystem.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Birds</h2>
			<p class="break">
			There is a wide variety of birds in the region, including: Cardinals, Green Heron, Blue Jay, Red-Headed Woodpecker, Wood Thrush, Seagull, as well as various owls.

			<h2>Plants</h2>
			<p class="break">
			In terms of trees, the ecozone is very diverse, containing both deciduous as well as evergreen trees, with more deciduous trees in the southern part, and more evergreen in the north. However, the amount of forests have decreased drastically due to urbanization, and only small pockets of dense forest remain in the south. Some common trees include the Maple, Oak, and Elm trees. Some common plants include the Clover and Sunflower, with the more rare Cattails and Water Lilies, as well as the plant of Ontario, the Trillium.
