			The Mixedwood Plains is a mostly flat ecozone, with a temperate climate and rich soils. Although the land is generally made of flat plains or rolling hills, there are many bodies of water, such as the Great Lakes and Lake Simcoe, as well as a few unique landmarks such as the Niagara Falls and Bruce Peninsula.

			<h1>Climate</h1>
			<hr>
			<p class="break">
			The climate of the ecozone is atypical of areas far inland, with the nearby Great Lakes providing the moderating effect of the oceans, as well as increased precipitation. The area has a relatively mild winter for a Canadian ecozone, with an average temperature of -5 °C, as well as a warm summer of 20 °C. The range of average temperatures is 25 °C, moderated by the Great Lakes, with a yearly total of 720-1000mm of precipitation per year, similar to the mean precipitation of 900mm per year in the inland Atlantic Maritime ecozone.

			<p class="break">
			The soil of the area is generally nutrient-rich leached luvisol soils towards the south and Great Lakes, whereas the northern area contains mostly leeched podzol. The majority of the soil is leached because of the increased precipitation from the Great Lakes, however the nutrients and minerals from previous glaciers and lakes help to counteract the fact. The southern areas are used for farming and agriculture, although much of the land has now been either used or damaged by urbanization. The northern soil however is more fit for forestry with the acidic conditions of the soil.
