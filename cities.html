			<h1>Similarity/Differences</h1>
			<p>
			There are many similarities between the climates of both cities, with both having warm to hot 
			summers and cold winters. Though Quebec's temperature range is smaller, both are slightly above average for 
			the Mixedwood Plains. They both also have high amounts of precipitation, although 
			Quebec has a relatively higher amount, perhaps due to the water supply coming in through the mouth 
			of the St. Lawrence River. Overall, both cities have similiar climates, with small differences depending on which 
			body of water the city is closest to.
